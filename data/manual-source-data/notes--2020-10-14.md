# Differences noted between report (produced on 2020-10-22) for date 2020-10-14

Officially, ten flights were made but the prototype was able to display only
nine. The benefit of both glider and tow plane being radio-equipped is that
when takeoff data is not received from one, the other might provide some
record of the event.

C-GYSO was not equipped with a Flarm or T-Beam radio on this date. Therefore,
no records of its flights could be recorded by the prototype.

The takeoff (13:33) and landing events of C-GFOP were not detected. It is known
that the glider was equipped with a Flarm or T-Beam on the day as some data
packets were received from the aircraft.

A number of DQK takeoffs were not detected. Given that the takeoffs for so many
other flights were detected, it seems likely that there are gaps in the data
received from DQK.

The official daily total for C-FUYE is shown as 1h 47m. The automatically
calculated total is 1h 37m 11s, a difference of ten minutes. This may be due to
human error.
